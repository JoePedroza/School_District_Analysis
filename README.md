# School_District_Analysis
Using Ananconda Jupyter with Python to analyze school district data.

## Resources 
- Data Source : schools_complete.csv , students_complete.csv 
- Tools : Python 3.7.6, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Overview 
A City School System chief data scientist has given the following tasks to complete the school analysis for the district to finalize the upcoming budget funding to the schools:
- Create the district summary Dataframe.
- Create the school summary Dataframe. 
- Find the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools. 
- Calculate the average math score received by students in each grade level at each school. 
- Calculate the average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school. 
- Calculate the school performance based on the spending per student. 
- Calculate the school performance based on the size of the school. 
- Calculate the school performance based on the type of school. 

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
